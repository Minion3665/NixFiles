This is a WIP program to change basic nix configuration options & rebuild. For now it's not ready, however it's still here as it's an important part of my plan for NixNext

It's not in a separate repo as I would prefer to keep it along with my nix for the time being for easier deployment, however in the future this may change. (i.e. I may move it to a submodule). If you have a use-case that requires this then please ask.
